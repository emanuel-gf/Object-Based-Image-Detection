# Object-Based-Image-Detection
This repository is a development of an object-based classification for an artificial landscape with a resolution of 0.2 meters. The aim is to classify the image into 8 classes that refer to land use and land cover. An OBIA (Object-Based Image Analysis) approach is used due to its object-based nature, which differs from pixel-based image analysis.
